## Current Sprint Focus (Next 7 Days)

### Immediate Priorities:
1. **Database Schema Creation** - Complete all table creation scripts
2. **Basic MVC Structure** - Build core controllers, models, and views  
3. **Tracking JavaScript** - Create ad-blocker resistant tracking code
4. **Authentication System** - Basic login/logout functionality
5. **Initial Dashboard** - Simple analytics display with real data

### Success Criteria:
- Database is created and populated with test data
- Basic tracking works and stores data correctly
- User can log in and see their analytics dashboard
- WordPress plugin can inject tracking code
- Core ad-blocker resistance features are functional

## Notes & Considerations

### Technical Debt:
- Start with simple implementations, optimize later
- Use TODO comments for future enhancements
- Document any shortcuts taken for future refactoring

### Risk Mitigation:
- Test ad-blocker resistance early and often
- Keep tracking code lightweight and fast
- Plan for database scaling from the beginning
- Ensure WordPress compatibility across versions
