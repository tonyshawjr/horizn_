== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is my tracking blocked by ad blockers? =

Unlike traditional analytics, horizn_ is specifically designed to be ad-blocker resistant. It uses:
- Multiple disguised endpoints (/wp-content/themes/assets/data.js, etc.)
- First-party requests (same domain)
- Multiple fallback methods (Beacon API, Fetch, XHR)

If you're still seeing blocks, check that your server can receive POST requests to the configured endpoints.

= How is this different from Google Analytics? =

**Privacy:** horizn_ keeps all data on your server vs. Google's servers
**Performance:** No external scripts to load vs. ~50KB+ external script  
**Accuracy:** Ad-blockers can't block first-party requests vs. 20-40% blocked
**Control:** You own your data 100% vs. shared with Google
**Compliance:** GDPR-friendly by default vs. requires consent management

= Does this work with caching plugins? =

Yes! horizn_ is designed to work with all major caching plugins:
- WP Rocket
- W3 Total Cache  
- WP Super Cache
- LiteSpeed Cache
- Cloudflare

The tracking script is injected dynamically and doesn't interfere with page caching.

= Can I use this with WooCommerce? =

Absolutely! horizn_ includes built-in WooCommerce integration:
- Automatic purchase tracking
- Add to cart events  
- Product page analytics
- Revenue reporting
- Customer journey tracking

Enable "E-commerce Tracking" in settings and it will automatically start tracking WooCommerce events.

= Is this GDPR compliant? =

Yes, horizn_ is designed to be privacy-friendly:
- No external data sharing
- Optional cookie-free tracking
- User opt-out controls
- Data anonymization options
- Automatic data cleanup

However, you should still review your privacy policy and consult legal counsel for complete compliance.

= How much does this impact page speed? =

Minimal impact:
- ~2KB compressed tracking script
- No external requests 
- Asynchronous loading
- Batched event sending
- Local processing only

Most sites see no measurable performance impact.

= Can I customize the tracking? =

Yes! horizn_ is highly customizable:
- Custom events via `horizn_track_event()`
- User identification with `horizn_identify_user()`
- Custom page data with `horizn_track_page()`
- Configurable endpoints and settings
- Developer hooks and filters
